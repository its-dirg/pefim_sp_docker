   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pefim_idp_docker's documentation!
============================================
This project contains docker build scripts to generate a docker image for a PEFIM sp based on https://github.com/its-dirg/pefim_sp.
You can also find an example how to configure and run the docker image.

This is an early alpha version and contains some temporary quick fixes to create a working proof of concept.
The intention is to refactor the code and configuration.

.. toctree::
